# AVR SD Hex Loader ISP

This project is all about getting your compiled sketch onto your target board without the need to have a connection to a computer running the Arduino IDE.

See the [SD Hex Loader ISP instructable](https://www.instructables.com/AVR-SD-Hex-Loader-ISP/) for a detailed description of this project.

# Till further notice use SDFat lib v1.1.0.  SDHexLoader.cpp isn't compatible with SDFat lib v2.
