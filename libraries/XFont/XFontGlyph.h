/*
*	The data is either 1 bit per pixel or run length encoded 8 bit.
*
*	Run length encoded 8 bit data: For each run the data starts with a signed
*	length byte.  If the length byte is positive the next byte should be
*	repeated length times.  If the length byte is negative, -length bytes should
*	be copied.  This optimizes the case where there are runs of unique pixel
*	values.
*
*	Note that the encoded data runs do not break at the end of each row.  The
*	data is assumed to be written to a defined window within the device RAM so
*	there is no need to break runs at the end of each row.
*
*	Example: CCCCABC would be encoded as 4C, -3ABC.
*	As an optimization, a positive run, such as 4C above, must have a minimum
*	length of 3 otherwise they're treated as unique pixels.
*
*	1 bit per pixel:  Each bit is a pixel as scanned horizontally, where the
*	most significant bit is visually on the left.  The data is stored packed.
*	The bits in a data byte may extend into the next row.
*
*	Example: Unrotated packed 5 pixel wide data with 3 rows is stored as
*			aaaaabbb bbcccccx  This saves quite a bit of space in some cases.
*			The same packing takes place for rotated, it's just columns rather
*			than rows.
*
*	Meaning of the FontHeader.vertical flag:
*	The vertical flag controls whether the rotated and packed data is stored
*	as horizontal or vertical strips.	Horizontal: 123		Vertical:	147
*													456					258
*													789					369
*
*	Horizontal is needed because some display controllers don't support
*	vertical addressing.  These controllers require multile bytes sent for each
*	data byte written in order to implement vertical addressing in software.
*	(e.g. ST7567 controller)
